## Integration Architecture Project 2022-2023
This project is a part of the course on Integration Architecture taken during the academic year 2022-2023. The project was developed by Fahid AlKhatieb, Jawad AlHaddadin, and Husam AlOmari.

The project uses the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) stack to create a web application that is able to compute the bonuses of salesmen based on their performance.

The project was developed keeping in mind the principles of integration architecture and the project is a perfect example of how different technologies can be integrated to create a full-fledged web application.
